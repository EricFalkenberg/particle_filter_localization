# Mobile Robot Programming Final Project
The given repository contains the source code written for our final project in Mobile Robot Programming (CSCI-632) at the Rochester Institute of Technology.

## Details
The goal of the project was to get our robot to a given destination point despite uncertainty as to its starting location as well as its model of motion. Thus we had to implement a form of localization which we chose to be particle-filter localization. Below you can see a video of our implementation in action on a Pioneer-3DX.
