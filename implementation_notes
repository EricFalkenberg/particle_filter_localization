USER VS. OBSERVATIONS
    User space should be a 6d grid of probabilities x,y,z,htheta,vtheta,rtheta all starting 
    with probability zero with the exception of 0,0,0,0,0,0

    Observation space should be a 3d grid where each individual x,y,z location
    contains 360 indices such that all degrees of theta can be represented.
